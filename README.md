# SAP Cloud SDK Pipeline - DEPRECATED! <a href="https://developers.sap.com/topics/cloud-sdk.html"><img src="https://help.sap.com/doc/6c02295dfa8f47cf9c08a19f2e172901/1.0/en-US/logo-for-cd.svg" alt="SAP Cloud SDK for Continuous Delivery Logo" height="122.92" width="226.773" align="right"/></a>

**WARNING:** This repository should not be used anymore. Instead, we recommend using the [General Purpose Pipeline of project "Piper"](https://sap.github.io/jenkins-library/stages/introduction/). The reasoning as well as further information how to adopt the General Purpose Pipeline are described in our [guide](gpp-guide.md).


## Description

The [SAP Cloud SDK](https://developers.sap.com/topics/cloud-sdk.html) helps to efficiently build, test, and deliver extensions of SAP solutions such as SAP S/4HANA.
This repository contains a Jenkins Pipeline-as-Code that enables development teams to assure a high level of quality on process as well as code level. While the SAP Cloud SDK enables to build high-quality cloud applications, this pipeline helps to assure high quality on project level by a set of standard and SDK-specific quality checks.

The pipeline supports the following types of projects:

* Java projects based on the [SAP Cloud SDK Archetypes](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sap.cloud.sdk.archetypes).
* JavaScript projects based on the [SAP Cloud SDK JavaScript Scaffolding](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-examples/tree/scaffolding-js).
* TypeScript projects based on the [SAP Cloud SDK TypeScript Scaffolding](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-examples/tree/scaffolding-ts).
* SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) projects based on the _SAP Cloud Platform Business Application_ SAP Web IDE Template.

You can find more details about the supported project types and build tools in our [documentation](doc/pipeline/build-tools.md).

## Requirements

### Hardware requirements

At least four gigabyte memory (available to Docker) and at least four gigabyte of disk space on the Jenkins master for downloading Docker images and the persistent storage of Jenkins.

The pipeline will refuse to run with less than one gigabyte available disk space to prevent a situation where the disk is running full.

### Software requirements

For instantiating the SAP Cloud SDK Cx Server, you need to provide a suitable host with a Linux operating system and Docker installed.
Please also ensure that the user with whom you start the Cx Server belongs to the `docker` group.

Please refer to the [operations guide](https://github.com/SAP/devops-docker-cx-server/blob/master/docs/operations/cx-server-operations-guide.md#system-requirement) for more details on hardware and software requirements.

Your project source files need to be available on a git or GitHub server, which is accessible from the Cx Server host.

## Download and Installation

The lifecycle of the Cx Server is maintained by a script called `cx-server`.
It can be found in the `cx-server` folder on the root of each SAP Cloud SDK project archetype.
Together with the `server.cfg` file, this is all you need for starting your instance of the SAP Cloud SDK Cx Server.

You might chose between the available archetypes, depending on the technology you prefer:

- `scp-cf-spring`
- `scp-cf-tomee`
- `scp-neo-javaee7`

To create a new project using the SDK execute the following command:

```shell
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=com.sap.cloud.sdk.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=scp-cf-tomee -DarchetypeVersion=RELEASE
```

To use one of the other archetypes, replace the value of `DarchetypeArtifactId` accordingly.

In the new project, there is a folder called `cx-server`.
This folder needs to be copied to the future host on which the Cx Server is intended to run.

On the host machine, navigate to the `cx-server` directory and ensure that the `cx-server` file is executable.
After that you can start the Jenkins server with following command:

```shell
./cx-server start
```

In Jenkins, click on "New Item" and create a new "Multi-branch Pipeline" for your repository.

### Versioning

The default `Jenkinsfile` consumes the `master` branch of the pipeline.
The `master` branch is continuously updated to the latest and greatest version of the pipeline.
However, those updates might in rare cases break your Jenkins build.

For productive usage, it is recommended to use a released version and update as new versions are released.
To do so, change the `pipelineVersion` to the respective git tag (for example `v15`).
Released versions, including release notes are listed on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline/releases).

To stay updated with new pipeline releases, it is recommended to watch the releases of the [cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline) repository.
Please refer to [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-and-unwatching-releases-for-a-repository/) for details on how to watch releases.
By doing so, you will be notified on GitHub when a new version of the pipeline is released, and can update accordingly.

It is recommended to always update to the latest version, for example by creating a pull request for the Jenkinsfile in your project.
By doing so, you will notice potential upgrade issues in the pull request.

For testing purposes, or because you want to use unreleased features early, you might want to consume the master branch of the pipeline.
Work in progress release notes which might describe a sub-set of what a new release containes are documented [here](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline/blob/master/release-notes-draft.md).
Please be aware that your pipeline might break without prior notice if you chose this option.
